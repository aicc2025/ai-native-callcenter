// An unbacked claim is the bot telling the caller it is doing something, or
// has done it, in a turn where nothing was done (#44). The flow cannot see
// one: its only events are tool results and silence, so "I'm transferring you"
// with no transfer_to_agent behind it moves no phase, arms no transfer and
// leaves the caller waiting for a person who is not coming. Live calls on qwen
// showed it for transfers ("I've already transferred you", ten turns running
// with the queue open), lookups ("我帮您查询一下", eight times with no lookup) and
// goodbyes with nothing ending the call.
//
// Detection reads the bot's own transcript, so it is a signal and not proof.
// The patterns are the claim's own phrasing — a first person doing the thing,
// or the thing reported done — and leave out the shapes that only offer it: a
// question, a condition, a "can" or "would you like". A claim missed here is
// one the conversation already hid; a claim invented here would make the
// count one nobody trusts, so the patterns err narrow.
